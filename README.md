Root Inspector
==========

This is an app that detects root. It uses a couple dozen methods to try to detect root, both via the SDK and NDK. Most root detection apps on the Play Store check for a few, or simply try to run su. This uses a lot of checks implemented by commercial apps, as well as some checks that haven't been seen. This can be used to test RootCloak or RootCloak Plus.
